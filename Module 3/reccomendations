Dear Manager,

	I am sending this email to report you that today I have concluded the analysis over trial stores and I am glad to claim that It was a great experience.
	
	The success of trial stores was evident in store 86 where the drivers to a significant Total Sales, customer and quantity of products, were overcome greatly in comparison to the last three months.
	However, store 88 even though performing a magnific trend in February and March, in April the number of customers not overcome the limits expected and the result was an insignificant Total Sales for that month.
	Then, store 77 was the most trendy of all. Over the three months, the number of customers was intercalated with products, setting the drivers for Total Sales differently only in March.
	Though the other 2 stores, 77 and 88, performed reasonable good,  we can claim the trial experience was a success, by the fact of such a smallest store performed better than the second-best store of the supermarket net. 
	
	After performing the statistical analysis of the trial stores, here comes some recommendations to the next trial stores:
I - Make a map of stores vy life stage, then the offers will be more attractive for the majority.
II - Be sure the quantity of products is enough in all trial
III - Take into consideration the distance of stores. If they are too close to each other the customers will tend to look for the best offer between them.

Thanks & cheers,
Ingrid Cadu
